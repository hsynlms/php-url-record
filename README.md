## php-url-record
> A simple slug generator. It's a PHP port from [nopCommerce](https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce) UrlRecord service.

## Why php-url-record?
The reason behind this repository is nopCommerce, is an open source ASP.NET Core based ecommerce solution. I just wanted to create a port of the nopCommerce SEO friendly slug generation service which is in production for years and trusted by tens of thousands of stores.

## Install

```
$ composer require hsynlms/url-record
```

## Usage

```php
use hsynlms\UrlRecord;

$slugGenerator = new UrlRecord();
echo $slugGenerator->GetSeoFriendlyName('nobodY d0es_it better');
// will return -> nobody-d0es_it-better
```
